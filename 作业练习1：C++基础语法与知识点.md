# 作业练习1：C++基础语法与知识点

面向对象程序设计（C++)

WHUT-CS 2022 Spring

### I. 作业目的

在编写设计良好的程序时，开发人员通常遵循以下几个步骤：

* **A**. 程序的目标任务、需求和约束
* **B**. 为实现目标任务设计适当的算法和数据结构
* **C**. 通过专门的程序设计语言编写程序实现所需的算法和数据结构

本次作业主要关注上述步骤中的(**C**)部分，其它部分将通过其他作业练习完成。作业练习中将针对不同的知识点（Knowledge Items）进行考察，通过编写实现指定功能点的程序巩固课程内容所涵盖的知识范围。

> 注意：作业练习的考察范围涵盖本课程的全部学习内容，不完全遵循授课章节的顺序，也不完全遵循课堂讲授范围，部分知识点的学习和运用需根据教材或参考书内容加以自学

### II. 作业要求

编写完成的程序需满足以下要求：

* **A**. 尽量使用C++语法风格的编程方式实现程序功能需求，避免使用C语法风格。例如：

  * 对于输入/输出操作，应使用C++中的 `cout` 和 `cin` 格式，而不应使用C中的 `printf` 和 `scanf` 格式
  * 包含头文件时，应使用C++中的 `cstring` 代替C中的 `string.h`

* **B**. 严格保持整洁的代码格式，并使用适当的注释规则对程序代码进行标注。例如：

  * 对于作业内容中的每条编程任务，在程序中应使用对应序号在相关代码处进行标注，格式为 `/* <n> */`

    > 例如：对于第5项作业任务 
    > ```
    > 5: Declare a variable of type int
    > ```
    > 程序中的对应代码及相关标注可以如下编写
    > ```
    > /* <5> */
    > int x;  
    > ```
  
  * 如果某条编程任务需要通过程序中的若干代码片段完成，则对应序号只需要在每个源程序中标注一次
  
  
  * 如果某行或某段代码同时实现了多条编程任务，则可以将多个对应任务序号标注在一起
  
    > 例如：如果一段表达式同时实现了任务4和任务6的需求，则可按照如下格式标注
    >
    > ```
    > /* <4> <6> */
    > // the implementation statements for task 4 and task 6
    > ```

### III. 相关知识点

本次作业练习内容主要涵盖以下知识点

* C++/C++2011程序的命令行编译
* C++程序结构及.cpp与.h文件之间的关联关系
  * 如何引用在其他文件中定义的标识符
* 基本数据类型、常量、变量、与数组
* 复合数据类型
* 结构、联合、枚举
* 变量与数组的初始化
* 在不同的内存区域中创建并存储数据
  * 静态内存区域
  * 调用栈区域
  * 内存堆区域
* 指针与引用
* 函数的定义、调用与参数传递
  * 在函数调用中传递数组参数
  * 使用函数解决简单的计算问题
* 递归函数的使用
* 循环语句
  * C++中新增的for循环语句风格

* 选择语句
* switch语句
* 输入与输出
  * cin 与 cout 的使用
  * 用户输入状态
  * 清除输入队列


* 文件的读写
* 命名空间的使用
* 模板方法的概念

### IV. 作业内容

 本节以任务点方式列出需要完成的设计任务，最终编写完成的程序中应涵盖所有任务功能点，并按照前述要求进行标注。部分任务中还标注了相关知识点和编程提示供参考。

1. Create 5 files `hmk1.cpp` ,  `tools.cpp` , `data.cpp` , `tools.h` , and `info.txt` . These are the files of this program.

   > **[KI]** The files in a program and their relationships
   >
   > **[Design]**
   >
   > * hmk1.cpp is the driver; it contains the main() function. 
   > * tools.cpp defines all the tool functions.
   > * tools.h is the corresponding head file. 
   > * data.cpp defines some data that can be used by other .cpp files. 
   > * info.txt , a file that your program will read and write.

2. In `hmk1.cpp` and `tools.cpp` include the head file needed for using `cout` and `cin` . 

3. In `tools.cpp` , include the library head files needed to call the library function `isspace` and `strlen` .

4. In `tools.cpp` , and `hmk1.cpp` , include the head file `tools.h`

5. Let `hmk1.cpp` contain only one function definition -- the `main()` function.

   > **[Hint]** mention <5> at some comment immediately above the definition of the main function. 

6. Let all of the other functions (except `main` ) be defined in `tools.cpp` . 
   
   > **[Hint]** mention <6> in some comment at the top of `tools.cpp` . 
   
7. Provide a function prototype in `tools.cpp` . The name of the function is `clear_input_queue` . It has no parameter and no return. It can only be called by the code in `tools.cpp` . 

   > **[Design]** Clearing the input queue is a technical operation. If it is called by some tool function, maybe a common user of the tool function (provided by `tools.cpp` ) does not need to know the details of it. So, maybe it is ok to hide `clear_input_queue()` for the code outside of `tools.cpp` . 

8. For all of functions defined in `tools.cpp` , except the "hidden" ones like `clear_input_queue()` , put their prototypes in `tools.h` .

   > **[KI]** content of head files.
   >
   > **[Hint]** you can decide which functions defined in `tools.cpp` are "hidden" (internal linkage).

9. In `tools.h` , create two symbolic constants (in two different ways) `TITLE_LEN` which is 80 `NAME_LEN` which is 50

   > **[Hint]** One by #define and the other by a const definition. 

10.  In `hmk1.cpp` , in the `main` function, define a local variable for each of the following types: 

    * Every char type. There are at least 5 different char types in C++. 
    * Every integer type (other than the char types). 
    * Every floating-point type.

    > **[KI]** Data types, constants, and storage holders

11. Initialize each of the local variables that are described in task 10, with a constant of its type.

    > **[Hint]** You can either initialize a variable by the same statement that declares it, or by a separate statement. 

12. In `tools.h` , create a structure ( struct ) data type called `Book` , which contains 3 fields:

    * `title` , which is an array of char, with the `TITLE_LEN` elements. 

    * `authors` , an array of char with `NAME_LEN` elements. 

    * `price` , a double. 

    * `id` , a union (about its type, you can choose it to be a nameless union type, or with some separately declared union type) of two fields

      * `isbn` . It will record some string

        > **[Hint]** For its implementation, you can choose a char array or a string object

      * `library_id` , which is an integer.

        > **[Design]** A book needs some id, which is either some ISBN number or a number chosen by the library, but not both. Therefore, for saving memory space, we can let id has an union type.

13. In `tools.h` , declare an enum type `Weekday` , which contains the enumerators for each day in a week, from `Mon` to `Sun` . 

14. In `tools.h` , declare a enum type `Month` , which contains the enumerators of each month, from `Jan` to `Dec` . 

15. In `tools.h` , declare a structure type called `Date` , which has three fields: 

    * `year` , an unsigned int
    * `month` , of the type `Month` . 
    * `weekday` , of the type `Weekday` .

16. In `hmk1.cpp` , define a global variable `today` , of the type `Date` . It has external linkage (can be used by other files). 

17. In `data.cpp` , create a global character array `myName` , with `NAME_LEN` elements. It can be used by the code of other files.

18. In `data.cpp` , define a global variable `bestBook` , whose type is `Book` . It has external linkage. 

    > **[Design]** The global names `today` , `myName` and `bestBook` are defined in two different files, and they all can be used by some other files.

19. In the function `main()` , asks the user the input data to initialize `today` , `myName` and `bestBook` . Then print the values of them.

20. In the function `main()` , declare a integer variable `x` such that its value cannot be modified.

21. In the `main()` function declare an integer pointer variable `xp` that

    * its value can be modified.
    * it cannot be used to modify that data tht it points to.

22. Declare an pointer variable `xp2` that

    * It points to an `int` array of 5 elements. 
    * It cannot be used to modify the data that it points to.

23. Declare an array `ar1` of 5 integer addresses.

24. Declare an function pointer variable `fp1` and initialize it with the library function name `strlen` , without using keyword `auto` .

25. Declare a variable `fp2` using the keyword `auto` , and initialize it with the library function name `strncpy` .

26. In the program, all of the data that are allocated using `new` or `new []` should be released by `delete` or `delete []` when they are not used any more or before the end of the program.

27. In a comment at the top of the `hmk1.c` , provide a command-line command that can compile the program into an executable file using the compiler g++/clang/msvc.

    > **[KI]** Compilation
    >
    > **[Hint]** All the .cpp files of the program are needed by the command line. Some features are supported only C++11, like the usage of `auto` . To allow c++11 features, some special option is needed in a command to use the specified compiler to compile the program. *

28. In a single statement using `cout` to print out values of at least 3 different names.

    > **[KI]** input and output

29. Show an example of a "message statement" mention in Page 61 of the English book "C++ Primer Plus (edition 6)" or in Page 34 of the Chinese book "C++ Primer Plus (edition 6)".

    > **[Hint]** Use some comment to indicate it. 

30. Print the largest value of `int` and smallest value of `long long` using some defined symbolic constant. 

31. Initialized a variable (Assign a value to a variable when declare it) using some syntax that is not allowed by C, but allowed by C++. 

32. Print the values of all the variables defined at task 10 (Do not use `printf`) 

    > **[Hint]** to print out a constant of each character type, see page 89 and 90 of the book "C++ Primer Plus (edition 6)". Do not use printf .

38. Record a sentence with multiple words, provided by the user, as an object of the `string` class. 

39. Input a single character and record it in some char variable. The input character can be space or return. 

40. In the `main` function, 

    * open the file `info.txt` . 

    * output (write) the string recorded in `myName` into the file, 

    * read the content of the file into some character array, and print it on the screen. 

      > **[Hint]** This is to check whether the operating of writing to file is successful. You can do it by reading the characters one by one and print them, or you can read the file content into some string (object or charcter array) and print the string.

41. In `tools.c` , provide the definition of the function `clear_input_queue` (Its prototype is described by task 7). It clears the input queue for the standard input stream (from keyboard).

    > **[KI]**: internal linkage (static global names); function definition; input queue. 
    >
    > **[Hint]** Use the c++ function `get()` repeatedly, until the newline character is extracted from the input queue. 

42. Call the function `clear_input_queue()` in the program at some proper situation. 

43. In `hmk1.cpp` , define the `main()` function. The computation of this function are partially described by the other task items. Especially,

    * Use some syntax of the for statement that is not allowed by C but allowed by C++. 

55. Define a function `week_plans()` , which has a parameter `day` of the type `Weekday` as its parameter, and then prints a different sentence for each day of a week. For example

    * if `day` is monday, it prints "Focus on study". 
    * if `day` is Friday, it prints "Have some fun". 
    * ...
    *  you have to use the `switch` statement to implement the function.
